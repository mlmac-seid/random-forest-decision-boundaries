# random-forest-decision-boundaries
This project visualizes decision boundaries of Random Forest classifiers trained on a subset of the Wine dataset from scikit-learn. It demonstrates how different hyperparameters affect the model's ability to separate classes in 2D feature space. Work completed for CS 3262 at Vanderbilt University.
